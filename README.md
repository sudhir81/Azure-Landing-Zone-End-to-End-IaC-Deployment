# ðŸš€ Azure Landing Zone â€“ End-to-End IaC Deployment

## ðŸ“Œ Project Status: Work in Progress

This repository is currently under development. Iâ€™m actively building a complete **enterprise-grade Azure Landing Zone** using **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** with Terraform.

The goal of this project is to design and deploy a **scalable, secure, and policy-driven Azure environment** â€” similar to whatâ€™s typically used in real-world enterprise deployments.
