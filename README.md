ðŸš§ Azure Landing Zone â€“ End-to-End IaC Deployment (Work in Progress)
ðŸ“Œ Project Status: Work in Progress

This repository is currently under development. Iâ€™m actively building a complete enterprise-grade Azure Landing Zone using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform.

The goal of this project is to design and deploy a scalable, secure, and policy-driven Azure environment â€” the kind typically used in real-world enterprise environments.
